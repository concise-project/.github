# CONcISE Project
### Computational imaging as a training network for smart biomedical devices

Funded within the framework of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) of the European Union (EU), and coordinated by Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, CONcISE is a new doctoral network set to bring to the market more data-efficient and quality-oriented techniques for biomedical optical imaging in biological tissues. The project follows an interdisciplinary approach, bringing together experts from academia and industry to develop novel, unconventional, and multi-dimensional computational imaging devices for biological tissues, where the hardware and the software are completely integrated and developed together.

The project aims to overcome traditional limitations of the current biomedical instrumentation, which focus on the maximisation of the data acquired. Current devices gather data regardless of its quality, unavoidably leading to a large amount of data to manage, transfer, and analyse and thus creating data bottlenecks and gaps in measurements.
